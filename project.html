    <p>The aim of my project was to investigate what are the best determinants of success in the summer Olympics by countries. </p>

    <h3>Question 1: Is there a relationship between the size of a country's economy and their peformance in the medal table?
    </h3>
    <!--Chart 1 -->
    <div class="chart" id="chart1">
        <script>
            var myChart1 = "Project/Chart1_GDP_Rio_Olympic_Medals_Chart.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart1', myChart1);
        </script>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>Chart 1 shows the relationship between a country's total GDP and their performance in the Olympics. We see that there is a positive relationship between GDP and medals won. The GDP, PPP (constant 2017 international $) is sourced from the World
            Bank's World Development Indicators database.</p>
        <p>When filtering the graph by continent, we see a much stronger relationship in Europe of higher GDP leading to more medals won.</p>
        <p>A challenge I faced when creating this chart was fitting all the countries on one visualtion. The US economy is nearly $3 trillion, compared to Barbados wth $3,636.80 million. I counteracted this issue by employing a logarithmic scale on the x-axis.
        </p>
    </div>

    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <h3>Question 2: Is there a reltionship between population size and Olympic success?</h3>
    <!--Chart 2 -->
    <div class="chart" id="chart2">
        <script>
            var myChart2 = "Project/Chart2_Population_Medals.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart2', myChart2);
        </script>
    </div>
    <div>
        <br>
        <p>Chart 2 shows the relationship between a country's popultaion and their performance in the Olympics. We see that there is a positive relationship between population size and medals won. The population data is sourced from the World Bank's World
            Development Indicators database.</p>
        <p>When filtering the graph by continent, we see a much stronger relationship in Europe of higher GDP leading to more medals won.</p>
        <p>A challenge I faced when creating this chart was fitting all the countries on one visualtion. The US has a population of 300 million, compared to Barbados wth x million. I counteracted this issue by employing a logarithmic scale on the x-axis.
        </p>
    </div>
    ><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <h3>Question 3: Which countries outperform in the olympics, considering their population?</h3>
    <!--Chart 2 -->
    <div class="chart" id="chart3">
        <script>
            var myChart3 = "Project/Chart3_Medals_Per_Capita_Chart.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart3', myChart3);
        </script>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Chart 3 shows which country's gain the highest number of medals compared to the size of their GDP. As we can see, North American islands, such as Jamaica overachive at the Olympics when we take into account the small size of their economy.</p>
