    <!--This paragraph provides a brief context and rationale behind the choice of my project subject-->
    <p>Aims: Following graduation from Bristol, I would potentially like to pursue a career in sports data analysis. With this in mind, I used the opportunity to combine sport and Economics in my Data Science project that investigates the relationship between
        economic indicators and a country's success at the summer Olympics.</p>
    <h3>Question 1: How strong is the relationship between the size of a country's economy and their peformance at the summer Olympics?
    </h3>

    <div class="container">
        <!--Chart 1: This chart is a scatter plot of GDP against Olympic medals won by countries -->
        <div class="chart" id="chart1">
            <script>
                var myChart1 = "Project/Chart1_GDP_Olympic_Medals_Chart.json";
                vegaEmbed('#chart1', myChart1);
            </script>
        </div>
        <!--Analysing the results-->
        <p>Fig.1 highlights a strong postive relationship between GDP and Olympic medals won. Until a country's economy has grown past $10 billion, it is very unlikely they will win a single medal in the games; Burandi, Samoa, and Grenada the few exceptions.
            Filtering by continent reveals that Europe exhibits the strongest positive correlation between GDP and medals won, and Africa the weakest. Excluding Kenya, Ethopia, and South Africa, African nations generally perform poorly in the olympics
            irrespective of the size of their economy. Nigeria has one of the largest economies in Africa, but was only able to secure one bronze medal in Rio 2016.</p>

        <p>While creating this visualisation, I decided to use GDP converted using the purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate because PPP allows for better cross-country comparison. A challenge in creating this visualisation was mapping countries on
            the same chart with very large variances in total GDP levels. For example, the US economy totalled $19,097 billion in 2016, whereas the South Pacific island nation Tuvalu's GDP was only $0.04 billion. I accounted for this issue by using a
            logarithmic scale on the x-axis.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Question 2: How strong is the relationship between population size and their performance at the summer Olympics?
    </h3>

    <div class="container">
        <!--Chart 2: This chart is a scatter plot of population size against Olympic medals won by countries-->
        <div class="chart" id="chart2">
            <script>
                var myChart2 = "Project/Chart2_Population_Medals.json";
                vegaEmbed('#chart2', myChart2);
            </script>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!--Analysing the results-->
    <p>Fig.2 looks visually very similar to Fig.1, which is unsurprising given that population size is a strong determinant of the size of a countries economy. Here we see that there is also a strong positive relationship between a countries population size
        and the number of medals they win. This effect is likely explained by greater athlete pools. China boasts a significant population size of 1,387.79 million people, increasing the likelihood of fostering athletes capable of qualifying. However,
        India does not follow this trend; their population is almost as large as China's and yet they perform considerbaly worse, only achieving two medals in 2016.

        <p>Like in Fig.1, I employed a logarithmic scale on the x-axis to visualise both very large and very small population sizes on one visualisation.
        </p>

        <h3>Question 3: Which countries overachieve in the olympics, considering their population size?</h3>

        <div class="container">
            <!--Chart 3: This chart is a bar chart ranking countries by the lowest people per medal won-->
            <div class="figure3" id="chart3">
                <script>
                    var myChart3 = "Project/Chart3_People_Per_Medal_Chart.json";
                    vegaEmbed('#chart3', myChart3);
                </script>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!--Analysing the results-->
        <p>For Beijing 2008, London 2012, and Rio 2016, Caribbean countries have stood out in winning Olympic medals given their small population sizes. For 2012 and 2016, Grenada ranked the highest for medals won per capita. These medals have generally
            been won in the sprinting category of athletics.
        </p>

        <h3>Question 4: Is there a strong relationhip between public money spent on sport and recreation, and Olympic sucess?
        </h3>

        <div class="container">
            <!--Chart 4: Scatter plot on the relationship between public funding and Olympic medals-->
            <div class="chart1" id="chart4">
                <script>
                    var myChart4 = "Project/Chart4_EU_Sport_Recreation_Spend.json";
                    vegaEmbed('#chart4', myChart4);
                </script>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!--Analysing the results-->
        <p>A weak relationship between public money expenditure on sports and recreation, and medals won was surprising. I hypothesised that rich countries generally gain more medals becasue they have greater funds available to invest in sporting facilities
            needed for athletes to train. However, this relationship was not shown in the 31 European countries I had data for.
        </p>
        <p>Luxembourg and Iceland stand out in terms of a poor return on invesment for Rio 2016; the two countries averaged €435.45 and €495.43 per capita respectively, gaining no medals at Rio 2016. Conversely, the United Kingdom gained a significant return
            on investment, acquiring 67 medals and only investing €75.70 per capita on average.
        </p>

        <!--Final section title-->
        <h3>Information on how the data was accessed and challenges in data cleaning:</h3>
        <!--Final section paragraph providing information on how the data was accessed-->
        <p>For figures 1-3, I accessed GDP (NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.KD) and population (SP.POP.TOTL) data from the World Bank API. By installing the WBGAPI python package on google colab, I was able to request, and load the World Development Indicators (WDI) into
            a pandas data frame. To access olympic medals data for the three games, I used the python package BeautifulSoup to web scrape Wikipedia pages fetching data from Olympics.com. For fig. 4, I accessed public expenditure data through donwloading
            a CSV file from the Eurostat website and loading this into google colab for manipulation.</p>
        <p>As part of my analysis, I performed a data join with the WDI indicators and olympic medals. Merging the datasets by country name proved challenging because there were many cases where different country names had been used by the World Bank compared
            to the scraped data. To overcome this, I used the World Bank economy coder function in python to access the 3 digit ISO codes recognised by the world bank for the country names. I then perfomed my join by ISO codes. The data cleaning process
            was mainly done by utilising the pandas data frame, such as dropping countries that had either missing population or GDP data.
